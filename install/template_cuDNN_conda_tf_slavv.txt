## Getting up to date

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --assume-yes upgrade
sudo apt-get --assume-yes install tmux build-essential gcc g++ make binutils
sudo apt-get --assume-yes install software-properties-common
sudo apt-get --assume-yes install git


## CuDNN
Since version 1.5 Tensorflow supports CuDNN 7, so we install that. To download CuDNN, one needs to register for a (free) developer account. After downloading, install with the following:

tar -xzf cudnn-9.0-linux-x64-v7.2.tgz
cd cuda
sudo cp lib64/* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
sudo cp include/* /usr/local/cuda/include/


## Anaconda
Anaconda is a great package manager for python. I’ve moved to python 3.6, so will be using the Anaconda 3 version:


## Tensorflow
The popular DL framework by Google. Installation:

sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install tensorflow-gpu


# Validate Tensorfow install: To make sure we have our stack running smoothly, I like to run the tensorflow MNIST example:

git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
python tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py


## Keras
Keras is a great high-level neural networks framework, an absolute pleasure to work with. Installation can’t be easier too:

pip install keras


## Removing CUDA/Nvidia drivers

If at any point the drivers or CUDA seem broken (as they did for me — multiple times), it might be better to start over by running:

sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo reboot
