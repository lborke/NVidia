How To Install CUDA 10.1 on Ubuntu 19.04
https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/How-To-Install-CUDA-10-1-on-Ubuntu-19-04-1405

So far I have installed CUDA 10.1,
docker 18.09.4 and NVIDIA-docker 2.03
and run TensorFlow 2 alpha with GPU support.
They are all working fine. In this post I'll just go over how to get CUDA 10.1 running on Ubuntu 19.04.
Fortunately it was straight forward do get it working.


## NVidia Treiber unter Ubuntu installieren

Step 1) Get Ubuntu 19.04 installed!

Step 2) Get the NVIDIA driver installed 

# I recommend using the most recent driver. The simplest way to install the driver is from the "graphics-drivers ppa".
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

# Install dependencies for the system to build the kernel modules,
sudo apt-get install dkms build-essential

# Then install the driver, (418 was the most recent at the time of this writing. If you do the command below and hit tab after typing nvidia-driver-
# you should see a list of all the available driver versions in the ppa.)
sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-418
# zuletzt versucht
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-430

# After the driver install go ahead and reboot.
sudo shutdown -r Now


Step 3) Install CUDA "dependencies" 

# There are a few dependencies that get installed when you run the full CUDA deb file but, since we are not going to use the deb file,
# you will want to install them separately. It's simple since we can get what's needed with just four package installs
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libxi-dev libxmu-dev


Step 4) Get the CUDA "run" file installer
Step 5) Run the "runfile" to install the CUDA toolkit and samples

https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=Ubuntu&target_version=1804&target_type=runfilelocal

wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.1/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.1.243_418.87.00_linux.run
sudo sh cuda_10.1.243_418.87.00_linux.run

We will not install the included display driver since the latest driver was installed in step 2)
This will do the "right thing". It will,
    install the CUDA toolkit in /usr/local/cuda-10.1
    create a symbolic link to /usr/local/cuda
    install the samples in /usr/local/cuda/samples and in your home directory under NVIDIA_CUDA-10.1_Samples
    add the appropriate library path

cat /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda-10-1.conf
>> /usr/local/cuda-10.1/targets/x86_64-linux/lib


Step 6) Setup your environment variables

To configure the CUDA environment for all users (and applications) on your system create the file (use sudo and a text editor of your choice)
# sudo nano cuda.sh ; sudo gedit cuda.sh

/etc/profile.d/cuda.sh

with the following content:
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda

The next time you login your shells will start with CUDA on your path and be ready to use. If you want to load that environment in a shell right now without logging out then just do:
source /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh

[optional, wurde gemacht]
Note on LIBRARY PATH:
Move the installed conf file out of the way:
sudo mv /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda-10-1.conf  /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda-10-1.conf-orig

Then create, (using sudo and your editor of choice), the file
# sudo gedit cuda.conf

/etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf
containing:
/usr/local/cuda/lib64

Then run:
sudo ldconfig


Step 7) Test CUDA by building the "samples" 

Let's make sure everything is working correctly. You can use the copy of the samples that the installer put in you home directory under `NVIDIA_CUDA-10.1_Samples` or copy the samples from `/usr/local/cuda/samples`.

cd  ~/NVIDIA_CUDA-10.1_Samples

: source cuda-10.1-env

make -j4

danach werden etliche Exe's kompiliert (via nvcc): in ~/NVIDIA_CUDA-10.1_Samples/bin/x86_64/linux/release

### Step Outputs

Step 5)
===========
= Summary =
===========

Driver:   Not Selected
Toolkit:  Installed in /usr/local/cuda-10.1/
Samples:  Installed in /home/lukas/

Please make sure that
 -   PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin
 -   LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-10.1/lib64, or, add /usr/local/cuda-10.1/lib64 to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root

To uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run cuda-uninstaller in /usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin

Please see CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf in /usr/local/cuda-10.1/doc/pdf for detailed information on setting up CUDA.
***WARNING: Incomplete installation! This installation did not install the CUDA Driver. A driver of version at least 418.00 is required for CUDA 10.1 functionality to work.
To install the driver using this installer, run the following command, replacing <CudaInstaller> with the name of this run file:
    sudo <CudaInstaller>.run --silent --driver

Logfile is /var/log/cuda-installer.log



### Mix / Versuche

# Die folgenden Pakete haben unerfüllte Abhängigkeiten:
# nvidia-settings : Hängt ab von: screen-resolution-extra (>= 0.18~) soll aber nicht installiert werden
: sudo apt install nvidia-settings
