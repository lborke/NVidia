your CUDA directory path is referred to as /usr/local/cuda/
your cuDNN download path is referred to as <cudnnpath>

Navigate to your <cudnnpath> directory containing the cuDNN Tar file.
Unzip the cuDNN package.

: tar -xzvf cudnn-9.0-linux-x64-v7.tgz
tar -xzvf cudnn-10.1-linux-x64-v7.6.4.38.tgz

Copy the following files into the CUDA Toolkit directory, and change the file permissions.

$ sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
$ sudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
$ sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*
